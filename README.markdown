# About
TVShows 2 "_Phoenix_" is the next version of [TVShows](http://deathtobunnies.com/tvshows/), the easiest way to download torrents of your favorite shows automatically. It includes a completely rewritten codebase as well as a major overhaul of the UI and a move to System Preferences. _Phoenix_ is currently in the beginning stages of development but I am always open to any feature suggestions.

## Important Notes
* TVShows 2 will not support Tiger. If anyone wants to write in Tiger support feel free but it only makes up 1.6% of users.
* By default, the Debug configuration automatically installs TVShows into `~/Library/PreferencePanes/` each time it's built.

## Planned Features
* Custom RSS feeds
* Support for NZB files
* Better support for non-standard naming conventions
* Display show and episode information
* Localized languages for non-English users
* Growl notifications for new downloads
* (?) <del>Multiple sources for each RSS feed</del>
* (?) <del>Feed categories: shows, music, podcasts, etc</del>
