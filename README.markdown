# About
TVShows 2 ("_Phoenix_") is the next iteration of [TVShows](http://deathtobunnies.com/tvshows/), the easiest way to download torrents of your favorite shows automatically. It will include a completely rewritten codebase as well as an overhaul of the UI (and a move to System Preferences). _Phoenix_ is currently in the late stages of planning but I am still open to any feature suggestions.

## Planned Features
* Custom RSS feeds
* Support for NZB files
* Better support for non-standard naming conventions
* Display show and episode information
* Localized languages for non-English users
* Growl notifications for new downloads
* (?) <del>Multiple sources for each RSS feed</del>
* (?) <del>Feed categories: shows, music, podcasts, etc</del>
